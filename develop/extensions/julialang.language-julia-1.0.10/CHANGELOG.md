# Change Log

All notable changes to the Julia extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.10] - 2020-11-13
### Added
* Support for Julia 1.5.3 and 1.5.4 default installation paths ([#1755](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1755), [#1759](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1759)).
* New up-to-date changelog ([#1750](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1750)).

### Changed
* Inline evaluation now adds the evaluated code to the REPL history *if* the `julia.codeInREPL` options is set ([#1754](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1754)).
* The extension now watches the global Manifest as well as Manifests in the workspace for changes and prompts the LS to re-index accordingly ([#1756](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1756)).

### Fixed
* Push internal Julia modules to the front of `LOAD_PATH` to prevent loading code from the workspace instead ([#1747](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1747)).
* Fixed a typo in the tableviewer code ([#1749](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1749)).
* Evaluation now uses unbuffered channels for communication, which might fix a rare off-by-one-result bug ([#1762](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1762)).

## [1.0.9] - 2020-11-04
### Added
* The workspace now shows errors encountered while rendering the tree view. Furthermore, it now only special cases `Array` and `Dict` instead of their `Abstract...` supertypes ([#1709](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1709)).
* Inline evaluation and the REPL can now be interrupted with the `Julia: Interrupt Execution` comamnd (or its default keyboard binding <kbd>ctrl+c</kbd>) ([#1690](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1690)).
* [ProgressLogging.jl](https://github.com/JunoLab/ProgressLogging.jl)'s progress bars are now displayed in the editor ([1579](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1579)).
* The language server process is now started with the `JULIA_LANGUAGESERVER` environment variable set to `1` ([#1707](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1707)).
* Added commands to re-start the LS or re-index the symbol cache ([#1721](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1721)).
* `@edit` now works properly on [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) instances ([#1737](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1737)).
* Added commands to `cd` to the current directory, `Pkg.activate` the current directory, or `Pkg.activate` the current files nearest project. These commands are also available in the file explorer ([#1743](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1743)).

### Changed
* Updated some JS dependencies.
* The plot pane is now opened in a new column by default, but also remembers it's last position ([#1554](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1554)).
* The `julia.NumThreads` setting is now machine-overrideable ([#1714](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1714)).
* Updated the Julia grammar definition ([#1720](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1720)), which [fixed various bugs](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/atom-language-julia/compare/v0.19.3...v0.20.0).
* `julia.usePlotPane` can now be changed without requiring the Julia process to be restarted. Additionally, the related `display` machinery is now much more robust ([#1729](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1729)).
* The "play" button in the editor toolbar now runs the file in the integrated REPL process ([#1728](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1728)).
* All inline results are now removed when the REPL process exits ([#1738](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1738)).

### Fixed
* Stracktraces are now rendered properly (i.e. with linebreaks) once again ([#1692](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1692)).
* The module indicator is now correctly initialized (instead of `Main`) ([#1516](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1516)).

## [1.0.8] - 2020-10-16
### Changed
* Both inline evaluation and the REPL now follow the changed soft-scope rules for Julia 1.5 and newer ([#1665](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1665)).
